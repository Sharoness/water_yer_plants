import React from 'react';

function ItemList() {
    return (
        <div>
            give me props so I can say: <br />
            *Name of plant* <br />
            Needs water in x days/Needs water tomorrow/Needs water today/You forgot to give yer *Name of plant* water. Do it now, save 'em! <br />
            Basically the same as Info, but this one is smaller because it's in a list.
        </div>
    )
}

export default ItemList;
